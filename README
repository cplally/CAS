CAS: A toy computer algebra system
============

Features:

Currently, CAS can differentiate and plot symbolic expressions (e.g., x^2,
sin(x), etc.). Beyond the usual algebraic expressions, CAS knows about the
basic trigonometric (sin, cos, tan)  and exponential (exp) functions.

Please bear in mind that CAS is a work in progress -- there will be some bugs,
and it isn't feature-complete. However, it will improve with time.

Usage:

Note: To use CAS, you will need Python 3 and gnuplot.
Here is a usage example:

     from cas import *
     
     f = Expr('sin(x)')
     print(f)
     f.plot(title='Sine', labels=('x', 'sin(x)'), range=((0,6.28), (-1,1)))
     
     print(f.d('x'))
     f.d('x').plot(title='Cosine', range=((0,6.28), (-1,1)))
